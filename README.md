# Coinwatch - Crypto market app

A web app built with ReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS. It fetches crypto market data from an external API and display it beautifully. 

Some of the packages I used in the project include:  

- Axios: for working with API.

- React-Icons: for all icons in the project.
- React-router-dom: for handling rounting in the application.

## Features

- Light/dark mode
- Fully responsive
- API integration
- Routing


## Lessons Learned

- I was able to wrap my head around React Context and learned how to use the useContext Hook having used it in implementing the app's light/dark mode theme. I learned that React context provides data to components no matter how deep they are in the components tree and is used to manage global data like global state, user settings, or in this case - theme and more.

- I learned and appreciated the powerful features of TailwindCSS. It boosts productivity because you don't have to waste time naming classes arbitrarily. There's maintainability since you always know exactly what styles are applied to which element. And defaults simplify creating awesome designs with consistency. 


## Challenges faced

I spent literally a whole day battling with a TailwindCSS configuration issue only to find out that I just needed to add @import somewhere in my index.css file, thanks to google and StackOverflow.
## What I would do differently

I would learn the latest version of the react-router-dom and use it in the project instead of using version 6.3.0 which I felt more comfortable with. I will definitely do so in my next React project.
